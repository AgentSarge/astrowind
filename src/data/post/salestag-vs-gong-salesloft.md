> Not all sales intelligence is created equal.

**Gong and SalesLoft revolutionized call analytics for inside sales. But field reps need more than Zoom recordings and CRM integrations.**

When we tell people about SalesTag, the first question is usually: "How is this different from Gong?" It's a fair question. Both companies have done incredible work in sales intelligence. But there's a fundamental difference in what problems we're solving — and where sales is heading.

## The Inside vs. Field Sales Divide

### What Gong and SalesLoft Excel At

Gong and SalesLoft were built for the world of inside sales:
- **Recorded video calls** (Zoom, Teams, etc.)
- **CRM integration** (Salesforce workflows)
- **Email sequences** (automated outreach)
- **Pipeline management** (deal progression tracking)
- **Post-call analytics** (after-the-fact insights)

These tools transformed inside sales teams by making the invisible visible. Suddenly, managers could see talk ratios, keyword frequency, and competitor mentions across hundreds of calls.

### Where Field Sales Gets Left Behind

But step outside the office, and these tools hit their limits:

**1. No Video Calls to Record**
A solar rep on someone's roof isn't on Zoom. A roofing contractor walking a damage inspection isn't sharing screens. A security systems rep in someone's living room isn't clicking through slide decks.

**2. Spotty CRM Adoption**
Field reps are notorious for poor CRM hygiene. They're focused on the next door, not data entry. By the time they update Salesforce, the nuance is gone.

**3. Real-Time Coaching Gaps**
Inside sales managers can listen in on calls and Slack immediate feedback. Field sales managers get secondhand summaries hours or days later.

**4. Context Loss**
A conversation in someone's kitchen carries different weight than a conference room presentation. Environmental factors, family dynamics, and physical space all matter — but don't translate to traditional sales tools.

## The SalesTag Approach: Built for the Real World

SalesTag was designed from day one for field sales reality:

### 1. Wearable, Always-On Intelligence

Our badge doesn't require setup, internet connection, or conscious activation. Clip it on, and it works. When voices are detected, it records. When the conversation ends, it stops. No friction, no forgetting to hit "record."

**Gong/SalesLoft**: Manual call recording setup
**SalesTag**: Automatic conversation capture

### 2. Real-Time Tagging and Analysis

While traditional tools analyze calls after they happen, SalesTag processes conversations in real-time. A rep can see objection patterns emerging during the pitch and adapt on the fly.

**Gong/SalesLoft**: Post-call dashboard insights
**SalesTag**: Real-time coaching suggestions

### 3. Environmental Context Awareness

SalesTag captures more than words. Our AI understands:
- **Location context** (residential vs. commercial)
- **Conversation length** (quick objection vs. deep dive)
- **Emotional tone shifts** (resistance → interest → decision)
- **Background cues** (family input, time pressure)

**Gong/SalesLoft**: Keyword and sentiment analysis
**SalesTag**: Full situational awareness

### 4. Private Vault Architecture

Traditional sales tools live in the cloud, accessible to platform providers. SalesTag gives teams complete data ownership. Your conversations stay in your private vault, encrypted and portable.

**Gong/SalesLoft**: Platform-dependent data
**SalesTag**: Team-owned intelligence vault

## Different Problems, Different Solutions

### The CRM Integration Question

"But what about CRM integration?" is the inevitable follow-up. Here's the thing: field reps don't want more CRM workflow. They want better insights.

SalesTag integrates with your CRM, but doesn't depend on it. A rep can get value from tagged conversations whether they update Salesforce or not. When they do sync, it's enriched with AI-generated summaries and coaching notes.

### The Scale Question

Gong analyzes thousands of calls per company. SalesTag takes a different approach: deeper analysis of fewer, higher-value conversations. We'd rather perfectly understand 100 field interactions than surface-analyze 1000 phone calls.

**Quality over quantity.**

### The AGI-Ready Question

This is where SalesTag's architecture really differentiates. While traditional tools built for today's needs, we built for tomorrow's possibilities.

Our conversation vault isn't just storage — it's training data for future AI agents. When AGI arrives, teams with structured, tagged, human-validated conversation data will have an insurmountable advantage.

## The Complementary Play

Here's a controversial take: **SalesTag doesn't replace Gong or SalesLoft. It complements them.**

The best sales organizations are hybrid. They have inside sales teams using traditional tools for qualification and follow-up. They have field teams using SalesTag for in-person closing and relationship building.

Some of our customers run both:
- **Inside reps** use Gong for video call analysis
- **Field reps** use SalesTag for in-person conversations
- **Managers** get unified insights across both channels

## The Future of Sales Intelligence

The real difference isn't features — it's vision.

Gong and SalesLoft see sales intelligence as **analytics**. SalesTag sees it as **memory**.

Analytics tell you what happened. Memory tells you what to do next.

Analytics are backwards-looking. Memory is forward-building.

Analytics optimize for metrics. Memory optimizes for wisdom.

### Three Scenarios, Three Tools

**Scenario 1: Inside Sales Team**
*50+ calls per day, standardized process, high volume*
→ **Gong or SalesLoft** (perfect fit)

**Scenario 2: Field Sales Team**
*8-12 in-person conversations per day, relationship-focused, high value*
→ **SalesTag** (purpose-built)

**Scenario 3: Hybrid Sales Org**
*Multi-channel approach, inside + field*
→ **Both tools** (complementary strengths)

## The Bottom Line

Gong and SalesLoft solved call analytics for inside sales. They're phenomenal at what they do.

SalesTag solves conversation memory for field sales. We're building something different, for different people, with different needs.

The question isn't "SalesTag vs. Gong" — it's "analytics vs. memory."

**For field sales teams that prioritize memory over metrics, depth over scale, and wisdom over data — SalesTag is the obvious choice.**

The future of sales is multi-channel, and every channel deserves purpose-built intelligence.
