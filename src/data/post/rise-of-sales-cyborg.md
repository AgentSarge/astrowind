> The best salespeople of tomorrow will be part human, part machine — and all authentic.

**SalesTag envisions a world where AI is a trusted companion, not a threat. Our badge augments reps with real-time insights, memory, and coaching, while keeping the human touch front and center.**

The term "cyborg" might conjure images of science fiction, but the reality is far more elegant: **humans enhanced by technology, not replaced by it**. In sales, this transformation is already beginning.

## Beyond the Replacement Myth

### The False Dichotomy

Too many conversations about AI in sales frame it as **humans vs. machines**:
