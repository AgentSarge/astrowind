    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-6">The SalesTag Vault</h1>
    
    <p class="text-xl mb-12 text-gray-600">
      Where human sales meets future intelligence. SalesTag captures every rep-to-homeowner conversation, 
      processes it with advanced labeling pipelines, and stores it in a private, AGI-aligned vault. 
      Perfect for fine-tuning LLMs or training safe autonomous agents.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 scroll-mt-24">Structured for Alignment</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Most data is noisy and unstructured. SalesTag organizes call audio, transcripts, objections, 
        sentiment, trust moments, and outcome metadata — giving future AIs a crystal-clear record of 
        how humans persuade, resist, and decide.

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 scroll-mt-24">Vertical-Aware Vaults</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Every vertical behaves differently. That's why we maintain separate vaults for solar, roofing, 
        alarms, and more — each with tailored labels, tags, and outcome taxonomies. Perfect for LLM 
        fine-tuning, safety evals, or agent simulation.

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 scroll-mt-24">Why It Matters</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Post-AGI, the greatest need will be high-signal human interaction data. Not scraped web content — 
        real decisions, tension, conflict, alignment. SalesTag gives you ownership of the most valuable 
        behavioral dataset in existence.
