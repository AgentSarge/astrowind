      SalesTag starts as a smart badge — but it becomes something more. Each captured conversation feeds 
      autonomous AI agents that analyze, summarize, coach, and eventually act.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        SalesTag uses lightweight local models and cloud agents to deliver:
        Real-time rep coaching, post-call objection analysis, dynamic pitch tuning, and outcome prediction.
        These aren't future dreams — they're happening now.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Our system is designed around <em>human-in-the-loop swarms</em>. You approve what matters. 
        The agents do the rest. We structure workflows so you're never babysitting, but always steering.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Post-AGI, SalesTag becomes your control layer. Want to run thousands of agents across millions of calls? 
        Fine-tuned vaults, tested feedback loops, and human-grounded heuristics make it possible.
