      <p class="text-xl mb-12 text-gray-600">
        We built SalesTag to solve a real-world problem: how to capture, analyze, and improve high-stakes human sales conversations. This page previews our system architecture and long-term research goals.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          SalesTag is designed not just for today's LLMs, but for future AGI agents. Every layer — from audio to embeddings — is optimized for privacy, extensibility, and future-proofing. <a href="#future" class="hover:text-blue-600 transition-colors underline">See future plans</a>.

        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Our system combines edge recording (ESP32 badge), Supabase pipelines, pgvector semantic search, LLM tagging (via OpenAI or Claude), and human-in-the-loop scoring — all into one self-updating vault.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 scroll-mt-24">Research Goals</h2>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          SalesTag isn't just a product — it's a dataset, a fine-tuning pipeline, and a testbed for alignment, RLHF, agent behavior, and safety experiments. We're open to research partnerships and joint papers.
