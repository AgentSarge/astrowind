    <p class="text-xl mb-12 text-gray-600">
      Aligning AGI with humanity starts with real human behavior — not benchmarks or synthetic tokens. 
      SalesTag captures authentic decision-making, persuasion, resistance, and trust in action. 
      It's the missing layer in scalable AI safety.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 scroll-mt-24">From Theory to Data</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Most alignment research is abstract. But models learn from examples. SalesTag provides high-fidelity 
        interaction sequences — every sales call is a lesson in goals, incentives, and interpersonal strategy. 
        Ideal for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), supervised fine-tuning, or safety 
        evaluation datasets.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 scroll-mt-24">The Alignment Bottleneck</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The biggest blockers to aligned AGI are: (1) lack of real-world data, (2) lack of contested decisions, 
        and (3) lack of structured annotation. SalesTag solves all three — producing labeled, reviewed, and 
        indexed episodes of value negotiation.

    <section class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4 scroll-mt-24">Why It's Urgent</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        As AGI capabilities accelerate, alignment lags behind. SalesTag helps rebalance the equation — not 
        through theory, but through evidence. High-signal, human-grounded episodes of conflict, persuasion, 
        and trust-building. A vault for learning how humans really think.
